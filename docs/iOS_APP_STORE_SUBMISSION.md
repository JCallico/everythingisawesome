## üîß What We Built

### Build Command Used
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace ios/EverythingIsAwesome.xcworkspace \
  -scheme EverythingIsAwesome \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination generic/platform=iOS \
  -archivePath ios/build/EverythingIsAwesome.xcarchive \
  archive \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
```

### Build Configuration
- **Configuration**: Release (optimized for distribution)
- **Platform**: iOS (arm64 architecture)
- **Code Signing**: Disabled for demonstration
- **JavaScript Bundling**: Embedded using Hermes engine
- **Optimization**: Full optimization enabled (-O flag)

## üöÄ Next Steps for App Store Submission

To submit this app to the App Store, you need to complete the following steps:

### 1. Set Up Apple Developer Account
- Enroll in the Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- Create an Apple ID and join the program
- Accept the latest agreements in Developer Portal

### 2. Configure Code Signing
You need to set up proper code signing certificates and provisioning profiles:

```bash
# Open Xcode project
open ios/EverythingIsAwesome.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select the EverythingIsAwesome project in navigator
# 2. Select the EverythingIsAwesome target
# 3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
# 4. Check "Automatically manage signing"
# 5. Select your development team from dropdown
# 6. Ensure bundle identifier is unique: com.yourcompany.everythingisawesome
```

### 3. Create App Store Connect Record
1. Log into [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Click "My Apps" ‚Üí "+" ‚Üí "New App"
3. Fill in app information:
   - Platform: iOS
   - Name: Everything Is Awesome
   - Primary Language: English
   - Bundle ID: com.yourcompany.everythingisawesome
   - SKU: unique identifier
4. Complete app metadata, screenshots, and descriptions

### 4. Build Signed Archive for Distribution
Once code signing is configured, build for App Store distribution:

```bash
cd mobile

# Build archive with proper code signing
xcodebuild -workspace ios/EverythingIsAwesome.xcworkspace \
  -scheme EverythingIsAwesome \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination generic/platform=iOS \
  -archivePath ios/build/EverythingIsAwesome.xcarchive \
  archive
```

### 5. Export IPA for App Store Submission
Use the ExportOptions.plist we created:

```bash
# Export IPA file for App Store submission
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath ios/build/EverythingIsAwesome.xcarchive \
  -exportPath ios/build/ipa \
  -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptions.plist
```

This will create `ios/build/ipa/EverythingIsAwesome.ipa` ready for upload.

### 6. Upload to App Store Connect
You can upload using either:

**Option A: Xcode Organizer**
```bash
# Open Xcode Organizer
open ios/EverythingIsAwesome.xcworkspace
# Window ‚Üí Organizer ‚Üí Archives tab
# Select your archive and click "Distribute App"
```

**Option B: Transporter App**
1. Download Transporter from Mac App Store
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Drag the `.ipa` file to upload

**Option C: Command Line (if you have altool configured)**
```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  --type ios \
  --file ios/build/ipa/EverythingIsAwesome.ipa \
  --username your-apple-id@example.com \
  --password your-app-specific-password
```

### 7. Submit for Review
1. In App Store Connect, go to your app
2. Create a new version
3. Fill in version information and release notes
4. Add screenshots for all required device sizes
5. Set pricing and availability
6. Submit for review
