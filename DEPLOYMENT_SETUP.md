# 🚀 Deployment Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the complete deployment pipeline with manual approval gates for the "Everything is Awesome" project.

## Overview

The deployment pipeline includes:
- ✅ **Automated Quality Gates**: Linting, building, and testing for all platforms
- 📱 **Multi-Platform Support**: Web (React) + Mobile (React Native + Expo) validation
- 📋 **Pre-Approval Summary**: Comprehensive build status review for all components
- 🔐 **Manual Approval Gate**: Human review before production deployment
- 🚀 **Automated Deployment**: Deploy to Azure Web App after approval

## 📱 Mobile Application Support

The pipeline now includes comprehensive support for the React Native mobile application:

### Mobile Quality Gates
- **📦 Dependencies**: Installs mobile npm packages including ESLint and Expo CLI
- **🔍 Code Quality**: ESLint validation with React Native specific rules
- **✅ App Validation**: Expo configuration and project structure validation
- **🧪 Testing**: Mobile-specific test execution (if configured)

### Mobile Build Process
The mobile app goes through these validation steps:
1. **Dependency Installation**: Install all mobile packages
2. **ESLint Analysis**: Check code quality with React Native rules
3. **Expo Configuration**: Validate app.json and project structure
4. **Build Readiness**: Verify critical files and dependencies exist

### Mobile Deployment Readiness
While the web application is automatically deployed to Azure, the mobile app is validated and prepared for:
- 📱 **Development Builds**: Ready for Expo development server
- 🏗️ **Production Builds**: Validated for iOS/Android builds
- 📦 **App Store Deployment**: Structure verified for submission

## 🔧 GitHub Environment Setup

To enable the manual approval gate, you need to configure a GitHub Environment with protection rules:

### Step 1: Create Production Environment

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environments**
3. Click **New environment**
4. Name it: `production`
5. Click **Configure environment**

### Step 2: Configure Protection Rules

In the environment configuration:

1. **Enable Required reviewers**:
   - Check ☑️ "Required reviewers"
   - Add team members or yourself who can approve deployments
   - Set "Required reviewers" to 1 or more

2. **Optional: Wait timer**:
   - Set a wait timer if you want delays before deployment
   - Useful for additional safety in production

3. **Optional: Environment secrets**:
   - Add any production-specific secrets here
   - These will be available only during deployment to this environment

4. **Environment URL** (already configured in workflow):
   - The workflow sets this to: `https://everythingisawesome.azurewebsites.net`

### Step 3: Save Configuration

Click **Save protection rules** to activate the manual approval gate.

## 📋 How the Approval Process Works

### 1. **Pre-Approval Summary Job**
When the build completes successfully, the `pre-approval-summary` job will:
- ✅ Display comprehensive quality gate results
- 📊 Show deployment target information
- 📝 Present a pre-deployment checklist
- 🎯 Confirm readiness for production

### 2. **Manual Approval**
The `approval` job will:
- ⏸️ **Pause** and wait for human intervention
- 📧 **Notify** configured reviewers (via email/GitHub notifications)
- 🖥️ **Display** approval interface in GitHub Actions UI
- ⏳ **Wait** until someone approves or rejects

### 3. **Reviewer Experience**
When reviewing:
1. **Navigate** to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. **Open** the pending workflow run
3. **Review** the build summary in the `pre-approval-summary` job logs
4. **Check** the step summary for detailed quality gate results
5. **Click** "Review pending deployments"
6. **Select** "production" environment
7. **Choose** "Approve and deploy" or "Reject"
8. **Optionally** add a comment explaining the decision

## 📊 Build Summary Visibility

The build summary is made visible to reviewers in multiple ways:

### 1. **Pre-Approval Summary Job**
- Detailed console output with quality gate results
- Step summary with formatted tables and checklists
- Clear status indicators for all build components

### 2. **GitHub Actions Summary**
- Markdown-formatted summary in the step summary
- Accessible via the "Summary" tab in the workflow run
- Includes deployment target information and checklist

### 3. **Approval Job Console**
- Confirmation of build status during approval
- Summary of what's being deployed
- Clear indication that approval was granted

## 🚀 Deployment Process

After approval:

1. **Artifact Download**: Retrieves build artifacts from the build job
2. **Azure Authentication**: Uses OIDC to authenticate with Azure
3. **Deployment**: Deploys the application to Azure Web App
4. **Verification**: Confirms deployment success
5. **Status Report**: Provides deployment summary and URL

## 🔍 Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No approval notification received**:
   - Check GitHub notification settings
   - Verify you're added as a required reviewer
   - Check the Environments settings

2. **Cannot see build summary**:
   - Check the `pre-approval-summary` job logs
   - Look at the workflow run Summary tab
   - Review the `approval` job output

3. **Approval not working**:
   - Verify the `production` environment exists
   - Check protection rules are enabled
   - Ensure you have the right permissions

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Test the workflow locally (build steps only)
npm install
npm run lint
cd client && npm install && npm run build

# Check Azure deployment manually
az webapp show --name everythingisawesome --resource-group your-rg
```

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Always review the build summary** before approving
2. **Check for any quality gate failures** in the logs
3. **Verify the deployment target** is correct
4. **Add comments** when rejecting to explain why
5. **Monitor the deployment** after approval for any issues
